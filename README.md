# [Project] Customer Segmentation, Course Project

**Goal**: Perform customer segmentation on retail data. The goal of this project is to perform  unsupervised learning using k-means clustering to segment the data. More attribute information and the data context can be read here: [Kaggle source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis)

## Introduction

This notebook was submitted as my final project for my statistics and probablistic learning class, using machine learning method to segment the customer data on which to conduct series of statistical analyses.

## Project Description



## Data Description

Data used is customer data collected during marketing compaign period. More attribute details can be [read here.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis)

## Conclusion

Concluding thoughts on the project, including insights gained and potential future directions for research.

Through clustering, I was able to distinguish which you will see among different characteristics like spending habits and parent status.


Potential future directions to try would be to use more than 2 clusters for segmentation, then try to identigy subclasses. It would be interesting to see what the algorithm comes up with as additional classifiers.
