# [Project] Customer Segmentation, Course Project

**Goal**: I will attempt to perform customer segmentation based on retail data. The goal of this project is to perform  unsupervised learning and clustering to summarize customer segment and population. More attribute information and the data context can be read here: [Kaggle source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis)

## Introduction

This notebook was submitted as my final project for my statistics and probablistic learning class, using machine learning method to segment or group the data on which to conduct series of statistical analyses.

## Project Description

This is an introuctory NLP project that uses Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify and classify named entities into predefined categories (e.g. characters listed in the book --> characters list). The goal of NER is to extract structured information from unstructured text data (Witcher books). In NLP, NER can help identify entities that are relevant to the question(s) being asked –

 * Which characters interact the most according to the network graph?
 * How are the characters naturally clustered around one another?

– which I will then turn to Network Analysis to analyze the different interactions and relations among entities identified through NER.
